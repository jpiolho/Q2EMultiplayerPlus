# FAQ
### How much does it increase the sliders?
It increases it to 32 players

### Can you really play with 32 players?
Probably not, at least not in online. The issue is that there's a bandwidth limit from the Playfab system that cannot be overriden. Effectively the players will start lagging out hard.
